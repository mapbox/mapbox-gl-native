# RenderTestRunner

This app is a purely native application, with no Java source code, that can run **mbgl-render-test-runner** on android devices.


## Setup the test environment
- Run render_test_setup.sh so that all the necessary test resources are pushed to the device.

- Switch on storage permission of the app so that it can read/write data on SD card.
