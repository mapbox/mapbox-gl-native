# Building & Developing from Source

**Just trying to use one of the Mapbox Maps SDKs? You don't need to read this stuff! We
provide [easy-to-install, prebuilt versions of the Mapbox Maps SDKs for iOS and Android
that you can download instantly and get started with fast](https://www.mapbox.com/install/).**

If you're certain you need to build from source, rather than using a prebuilt SDK, please
refer to the installation instructions for the platform of interest:

* [Mapbox Maps SDK for Android](platform/android/README.md)
* [Mapbox Maps SDK for iOS](platform/ios/INSTALL.md)
* [Mapbox Maps SDK for macOS](platform/macos/INSTALL.md)
* [Mapbox Maps SDK for Qt](platform/qt/README.md)
* [Mapbox GL Native on Linux](platform/linux/README.md)
* [node-mapbox-gl-native](platform/node/DEVELOPING.md)
