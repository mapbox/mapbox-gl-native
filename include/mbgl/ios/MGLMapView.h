/** An MGLMapView object provides an embeddable map interface, similar to the one provided by Apple's MapKit. You use this class to display map information and to manipulate the map contents from your application. You can center the map on a given coordinate, specify the size of the area you want to display, and style the features of the map to fit your application's use case.
*
*   Use of MGLMapView requires a Mapbox API access token. Obtain an access token on the [Mapbox account page](https://www.mapbox.com/account/apps/). If you instantiate an MGLMapView from Interface Builder, rendering of the map won't begin until the accessToken property has been set.

/* Tells the delegate that the user tapped one of the annotation's accessory buttons.
*
*  Accessory views contain custom content and are positioned on either side of the annotation title text. If a view you specify is a descendant of the `UIControl` class, the map view calls this method as a convenience whenever the user taps your view. You can use this method to respond to taps and perform any actions associated with that control. For example, if your control displayed additional information about the annotation, you could use this method to present a modal panel with that information.
*
*  If your custom accessory views are not descendants of the `UIControl` class, the map view does not call this method.
*
*  @param mapView The map view containing the specified annotation.
*  @param annotation The annotation whose button was tapped.
