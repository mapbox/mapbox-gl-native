# Mapbox macOS SDK

[![Bitrise](https://www.bitrise.io/app/155ef7da24b38dcd.svg?token=4KSOw_gd6WxTnvGE2rMttg&branch=master)](https://www.bitrise.io/app/155ef7da24b38dcd)

A library based on [Mapbox GL Native](../../README.md) for embedding interactive map views with scalable, customizable vector maps into Cocoa applications on macOS 10.10.0 and above using Objective-C, Swift, Interface Builder, or AppleScript.

This SDK is analogous to the Mapbox iOS SDK, and much of the iOS SDK documentation applies here. Mapbox does not officially support the macOS SDK to the same extent as the iOS SDK; however, bug reports and pull requests are certainly welcome.
