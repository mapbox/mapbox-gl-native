# macOS

This folder contains build configuration files for the macOS distribution of Mapbox GL Native, which ultimately targets Cocoa applications written in Objective-C, Swift, Interface Builder, or AppleScript via the [Mapbox Maps SDK for macOS](https://mapbox.github.io/mapbox-gl-native/macos/). The SDK was previously developed here in this repository but is now developed [in the separate mapbox-gl-native-ios repository](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native-ios/tree/master/platform/macos/) ([details](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/issues/15971)).
