 The `MGLMapViewDelegate` protocol defines a set of optional methods that you
 can use to receive messages from an `MGLMapView` instance. Because many map
 operations require the `MGLMapView` class to load data asynchronously, the map
 view calls these methods to notify your application when specific operations
 complete. The map view also uses these methods to request information about
 annotations displayed on the map, such as the styles and interaction modes to
 apply to individual annotations.

 controller’s content view to KVO-compliant properties of the annotation object,
