# Info.plist Keys

The Mapbox macOS SDK supports custom `Info.plist` keys in your application in order to configure various settings.

## MGLMapboxAccessToken

Set the [Mapbox access token](https://www.mapbox.com/help/define-access-token/) to be used by all instances of `MGLMapView` in the current application.

Mapbox-hosted vector tiles and styles require an API access token, which you can obtain from the [Mapbox account page](https://www.mapbox.com/studio/account/tokens/). Access tokens associate requests to Mapboxâ€™s vector tile and style APIs with your Mapbox account. They also deter other developers from using your styles without your permission.

As an alternative, you can use `+[MGLAccountManager setAccessToken:]` to set a token in code. See [our guide](https://www.mapbox.com/help/ios-private-access-token/) for some tips on keeping access tokens in open source code private.

## MGLMapboxAPIBaseURL

Use this key if you need to customize the API base URL used throughout the SDK. If unset, the default Mapbox API is used.

The default value is `https://api.mapbox.com`.
