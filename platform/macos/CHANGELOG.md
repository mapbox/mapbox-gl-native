# Changelog for Mapbox Maps SDK for macOS

## master
* Added support for [image expression](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/#expressions-types-image) in core library. Runtime APIs for image expression will be implemented separately. ([#15877](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/15877))
* Fixed crashes triggered when `MGLSource` and `MGLStyleLayer` objects are accessed after having been invalidated after a style change. ([#15539](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/15539))
* Fixed an issue where it was possible to set the map’s content insets then tilt the map enough to see the horizon, causing performance issues. ([#15195](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/15195))
* Added an `MGLMapView.prefetchesTiles` property to configure lower-resolution tile prefetching behavior. ([#14816](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/14816))
* Fixed queryRenderedFeatues bug caused by incorrect sort feature index calculation. ([#14884](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/14884))
* Ideographic glyphs from Chinese, Japanese, and Korean are no longer downloaded by default as part of offline packs; they are instead rendered on-device, saving bandwidth and storage while improving performance. ([#14176](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/14176))
* The `MGLIdeographicFontFamilyName` Info.plist key now also accepts an array of font family names, to customize font fallback behavior. It can also be set to a Boolean value of `NO` to force the SDK to typeset CJK characters in a remote font specified by `MGLSymbolStyleLayer.textFontNames`. ([#14862](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/14862)) 
* Performance improvements for queryRenderedFeatures API and optimization that allocates containers based on a number of rendered layers. ([#14930](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/14930))
* Fixed rendering layers after fill-extrusion regression caused by optimization of fill-extrusion rendering. ([#15065](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/15065))
* `MGLLoggingLevel` has been updated for better matching core log levels. Now can use `[MGLLoggingConfiguration sharedConfiguration].loggingLevel` to filter logs from core . ([#15120](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/15120))
* Fixed an issue where animated camera transitions zoomed in or out too dramatically. ([#15281](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/15281))
* Fixed rendering and collision detection issues with using `text-variable-anchor` and `icon-text-fit` properties on the same layer. ([#15367](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/15367))
* Fixed symbol overlap when zooming out quickly. ([15416](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/15416))
* Fixed a rendering issue that non-SDF icon would be treated as SDF icon if they are in the same layer. ([#15456](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/15456))
* Fixed a rendering issue of `collisionBox` when `text-translate` or `icon-translate` is enabled. ([#15467](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/15467))
* Fixed an issue of integer overflow when converting `tileCoordinates` to `LatLon`, which caused issues such as `queryRenderedFeatures` and `querySourceFeatures` returning incorrect coordinates at zoom levels 20 and higher. ([#15560](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/15560))
* Added an `-[MGLMapSnapshotter startWithOverlayHandler:completionHandler:]` method to provide the snapshot's current `CGContext` in order to perform custom drawing on `MGLMapSnapShot` objects. ([#15530](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/15530))
* Fixed an issue that `maxzoom` in style `Sources` option was ignored when URL resource is provided. It may cause problems such as extra tiles downloading at higher zoom level than `maxzoom`, or problems that wrong setting of `overscaledZ` in `OverscaledTileID` that will be passed to `SymbolLayout`, leading wrong rendering appearance. ([#15581](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/15581))
* Fixed a crash when `-[MGLOfflinePack invalidate]` is called on different threads. ([#15582](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/15582))

### Styles and rendering

* Setting `MGLMapView.contentInset` now moves the map’s focal point to the center of the content frame after insetting. ([#14664](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/14664))
* Added the `-[MGLMapViewDelegate mapView:shouldRemoveStyleImage:]` method for optimizing style image caching. ([#14769](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/14769))
* Introduce `text-writing-mode` layout property for symbol layer ([#14932](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/14932)). The `text-writing-mode` layout property allows control over symbol's preferred writing mode. The new property value is an array, whose values are enumeration values from a ( `horizontal` | `vertical` ) set.

### Other changes

* The `-[MGLMapView setCamera:withDuration:animationTimingFunction:edgePadding:completionHandler:]` method now adds the current value of the `MGLMapView.contentInsets` property to the `edgePadding` parameter. ([#14813](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/14813))
* Updated "map ID" to the more accurate term "tileset ID" in documentation; updated "style's Map ID" to the more accurate term "style URL". ([#15116](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/15116))

### Other changes

* Added variants of multiple animated `MGLMapView` methods that accept completion handlers ([#14381](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/14381)):
  * `-[MGLMapView setVisibleCoordinateBounds:edgePadding:animated:completionHandler:]`
  * `-[MGLMapView setContentInsets:animated:completionHandler:]`
  * `-[MGLMapView showAnnotations:edgePadding:animated:completionHandler:]`

* Added `FIRST`, `LAST`, and `SIZE` symbolic array subscripting support to expressions. ([#11770](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/11770))
* Inside an expression, casting `nil` to a string turns it into the empty string instead of the string `"null"`. ([#11904](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/11904))
* Fixed an issue where certain colors were being misrepresented in `NSExpression` obtained from `MGLStyleLayer` getters. ([#11725](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/11725))

### Annotations

* Fixed an issue where selecting an onscreen annotation could move the map unintentionally. ([#11731](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/11731))
* Fixed an issue where an `MGLOverlay` object straddling the antimeridian had an empty `MGLOverlay.overlayBounds` value. ([#11783](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/11783))

### Other changes

* Reduced per-frame render CPU time. ([#11811](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/issues/11811))
* Fixed a crash when removing an `MGLOfflinePack`. ([#6092](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/issues/6092))
* If English is the first language listed in the user’s Preferred Languages setting, `-[MGLStyle localizeLabelsIntoLocale:]` no longer prioritizes other languages over English. ([#11907](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/11907))

## 0.7.0 - April 19, 2018

The 0.7._x_ series of releases will be the last to support macOS 10.10. The minimum macOS deployment version will increase to macOS 10.11.0 in a future release.

### Packaging

* Added Arabic, Danish, Hebrew, and European Portuguese localizations. ([#10967](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/10967), [#11136](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/11134), [#11695](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/11695))
* Removed methods, properties, and constants that had been deprecated as of v0.6.1. ([#11205](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/11205))
* Refined certain Swift interfaces by converting them from class methods to class properties. ([#11674](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/11674))

### Style layers

* The layout and paint properties on subclasses of `MGLStyleLayer` are now of type `NSExpression` instead of `MGLStyleValue`. A new “Predicates and Expressions” guide provides an overview of the supported operators, which include arithmetic and conditional operators. ([#10726](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/10726))
* A style can now display a heatmap layer that visualizes a point data distribution. You can customize the appearance at runtime using the `MGLHeatmapStyleLayer` class. ([#11046](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/11046))
* A style can now display a smooth hillshading layer and customize its appearance at runtime using the `MGLHillshadeStyleLayer` class. Hillshading is based on a rasterized digital elevation model supplied by the `MGLRasterDEMSource` class. ([#10642](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/10642))
* You can now set the `MGLVectorStyleLayer.predicate` property to a predicate that contains arithmetic and calls to built-in `NSExpression` functions. You may need to cast a feature attribute key to `NSString` or `NSNumber` before comparing it to a string or number. ([#11587](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/11587))
* Replaced the `MGLStyle.localizesLabels` property with an `-[MGLStyle localizeLabelsIntoLocale:]` method that allows you to specify the language to localize into. Note that this method does not automatically update the style when the system’s preferred language changes. Also added an `-[NSExpression(MGLAdditions) mgl_expressionLocalizedIntoLocale:]` method for localizing an individual value used with `MGLSymbolStyleLayer.text`. ([#11651](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/11651))
* Fixed incorrect color calibration on macOS 10.13 High Sierra when using color-related methods of `MGLStyleLayer` subclasses, as well as when displaying an `MGLAttributionInfo`. It is no longer necessary to explicitly convert an `NSColor` to the sRGB color space before using these classes on High Sierra. ([#11391](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/11391))
* The `MGLSymbolStyleLayer.textFontNames` property can now depend on a feature’s attributes. ([#10850](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/10850))
* Changes to the `MGLStyleLayer.minimumZoomLevel` and `MGLStyleLayer.maximumZoomLevel` properties take effect immediately. ([#11399](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/11399))

### Content sources

* Renamed `MGLRasterSource` to `MGLRasterTileSource` and `MGLVectorSource` to `MGLVectorTileSource`. ([#11568](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/11568))
* Added an `MGLComputedShapeSource` class that allows applications to supply vector data to a style layer on a per-tile basis. ([#9983](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9983))
* Properties such as `MGLSymbolStyleLayer.iconAllowsOverlap` and `MGLSymbolStyleLayer.iconIgnoresPlacement` now account for symbols in other sources. ([#10436](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/10436))

### Map rendering

* Improved the reliability of collision detection between symbols near the edges of tiles, as well as between symbols when the map is tilted. It is no longer necessary to enable `MGLSymbolStyleLayer.symbolAvoidsEdges` to prevent symbols in adjacent tiles from overlapping with each other. ([#10436](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/10436))
* Symbols can fade in and out as the map pans, rotates, or tilts. ([#10436](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/10436))
* Properties such as `MGLSymbolStyleLayer.iconAllowsOverlap` and `MGLSymbolStyleLayer.iconIgnoresPlacement` now account for symbols in other sources. ([#10436](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/10436))
* Added the `MGLTileSourceOptionTileCoordinateBounds` option to create an `MGLTileSource` that only supplies tiles within a specific geographic bounding box. ([#11141](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/11141))
* Fixed an issue preventing a dynamically-added `MGLRasterStyleLayer` from drawing until the map pans. ([#10270](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/10270))
* Fixed an issue preventing `MGLImageSource`s from drawing on the map when the map is zoomed in and tilted. ([#10677](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/10677))
* Improved the sharpness of raster tiles on Retina displays. ([#10984](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/10984))
* Fixed a crash parsing a malformed style. ([#11001](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/11001))
* Fixed an issue where symbols with empty labels would always be hidden. ([#11206](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/11206))
* Fixed an issue where a tilted map could flicker while displaying rotating symbols. ([#11488](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/11488))
* Increased the maximum width of labels by a factor of two. ([#11508](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/11508))

### Annotations

* Fixed an issue where tapping a group of annotations may not have selected the nearest annotation. ([#11438](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/11438))
* The `MGLMapView.selectedAnnotations` property (backed by `-[MGLMapView setSelectedAnnotations:]`) now selects annotations that are off-screen. ([#9790](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/issues/9790))
* The `animated` parameter to `-[MGLMapView selectAnnotation:animated:]` now controls whether the annotation and its callout are brought on-screen. If `animated` is `NO` then the annotation is selected if offscreen, but the map is not panned. Currently only point annotations are supported.([#3249](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/issues/3249))
* Fixed a crash when rapidly adding and removing annotations. ([#11551](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/issues/11551), [#11575](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/issues/11575))

### Map snapshots

* Fixed a memory leak that occurred when creating a map snapshot. ([#10585](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/10585))
* Fixed an issue that caused `MGLMapSnapshotter.pointForCoordinate` to return an incorrect value. ([#11035](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/11035))

### Other changes

* The `-[MGLMapView convertRect:toCoordinateBoundsFromView:]` method and the `MGLMapView.visibleCoordinateBounds` property’s getter now indicate that the coordinate bounds straddles the antimeridian by extending one side beyond ±180 degrees longitude. ([#11265](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/11265))
* Feature querying results now account for the `MGLSymbolStyleLayer.circleStrokeWidth` property. ([#10897](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/10897))
* Reduced offline download sizes for styles with symbol layers that render only icons, and no text. ([#11055](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/11055))

## v0.6.1 - January 16, 2018

This version of the Mapbox macOS SDK corresponds to version 3.7.3 of the Mapbox Maps SDK for iOS.

* Fixed a crash while zooming while annotations are present on the map. ([#10791](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/10791))
* CJK characters can be displayed in a locally installed font or a custom font bundled with the application, reducing map download times. Specify the font name using the `MGLIdeographicFontFamilyName` key in the application’s Info.plist file. ([#10522](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/10522))

## v0.6.0 - December 23, 2017

This version of the Mapbox macOS SDK corresponds to version 3.7.2 of the Mapbox Maps SDK for iOS.

### Packaging

* Renamed this SDK from Mapbox macOS SDK to Mapbox Maps SDK for macOS. ([#10610](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/10610), [#10793](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/10793))
* Added a Bulgarian localization. ([#10309](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/10309))

### Networking and storage

* Added a new `MGLMapSnapshotter` class for capturing rendered map images from an `MGLMapView`’s camera. ([#9891](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9891))
* Reduced the time it takes to create new `MGLMapView` instances in some cases. ([#9864](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9864))
* Added support for forced cache revalidation that will eliminate flickering that was sometimes visible for certain types of tiles (e.g., traffic tiles). ([#9670](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9670), [#9103](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/issues/9103))
* Improved the performance of the SDK when parsing vector tile data used to render the map. ([#9312](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9312))

### Styles

* Added a new type of source, represented by the `MGLImageSource` class at runtime, that displays a georeferenced image. ([#9110](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9110))
* Setting a style using `MGLMapView`'s `styleURL` property now smoothly transitions from the previous style to the new style and maintains equivalent layers and sources along with their identifiers. ([#9256](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9256))
* Added `MGLCircleStyleLayer.circlePitchAlignment` and `MGLSymbolStyleLayer.iconPitchAlignment` properties to control whether circles and symbols lie flat against a tilted map. ([#9426](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9426), [#9479](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9479))
* Added an `MGLSymbolStyleLayer.iconAnchor` property to control where an icon is anchored. ([#9849](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9849))
* The `maximumTextWidth` and `textLetterSpacing` properties of `MGLSymbolStyleLayer` are now compatible with `MGLSourceStyleFunction`s and `MGLCompositeStyleFunction`s, allowing data-driven styling of these properties. ([#9870](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9870))
* Improved the legibility of labels that follow lines when the map is tilted. ([#9009](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9009))
* Fixed an issue that could cause flickering when a translucent raster style layer was present. ([#9468](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9468))
* Fixed an issue that could cause antialiasing between polygons on the same layer to fail if the fill layers used data-driven styling for the fill color. ([#9699](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9699))
* The previously deprecated support for style classes has been removed. For interface compatibility, the API methods remain, but they are now non-functional.

### Annotations and user interaction

* Fixed several bugs and performance issues related to the use of annotations backed by `MGLAnnotationImage`s. The limits on the number and size of images and glyphs has been effectively eliminated and should now depend on hardware constraints. These fixes also apply to images used to represent icons in `MGLSymbolStyleLayer`s. ([#9213](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9213))
* Increased the default maximum zoom level from 20 to 22. ([#9835](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9835))
* Added an `overlays` property to `MGLMapView`. ([#8617](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8617))
* Fixed incorrect hit targets for `MGLAnnotationImage`-backed annotations that caused `-[MGLMapViewDelegate mapView:didSelectAnnotation:]` to be called unnecessarily. ([#10538](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/10538))
* Added `-[MGLMapView cameraThatFitsShape:direction:edgePadding:]` to get a camera with zoom level and center coordinate computed to fit a shape. ([#10107](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/10107))
* Added support selection of shape and polyline annotations.([#9984](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9984))
* Fixed an issue where a shape annotation callout was not displayed if the centroid was not visible. ([#10255](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/10255))

### Other changes

* Fixed distortion in the logo view on macOS 10.13 High Sierra. ([#10606](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/10606))
* Fixed an issue that could cause line label rendering glitches when the line geometry is projected to a point behind the plane of the camera. ([#9865](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9865))
* Fixed an issue that could cause a crash when using `-[MGLMapView flyToCamera:completionHandler:]` and related methods with zoom levels at or near the maximum value. ([#9381](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9381))
* Fixed an issue where removing a `MGLOpenGLStyleLayer` from a map might result in a crash. ([#10765](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/10765))
* Added documentation for usage of coordinate bounds that cross the anti-meridian. ([#10783](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/10783))
* Removed duplicated variables in `MGLMapSnapshotter`. ([#10702](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/10702))

## 0.5.1 - September 26, 2017

This version of the Mapbox macOS SDK corresponds to version 3.6.4 of the Mapbox iOS SDK.

* Added an `MGLStyle.localizesLabels` property, off by default, that localizes any Mapbox Streets–sourced symbol layer into the user’s preferred language. ([#9582](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9582))
* Fixed an issue that caused `-[MGLShapeSource featuresMatchingPredicate:]` and `-[MGLVectorSource featuresInSourceLayersWithIdentifiers:predicate:]` to always return an empty array. ([#9784](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9784))
* `MGLMapView`’s `minimumZoomLevel` and `maximumZoomLevel` properties are now available in Interface Builder’s Attributes inspector. ([#9729](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9729))
* Added a Hungarian localization. ([#9945](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9945))
* Deprecated `+[MGLStyle trafficDayStyleURL]` and `+[MGLStyle trafficNightStyleURL]` with no replacement method. To use the Traffic Day and Traffic Night styles going forward, we recommend that you use the underlying URL. ([#9918](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9918))
* Fixed an issue where stale (but still valid) map data could be ignored in offline mode. ([#10012](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/10012))

## 0.5.0 - June 30, 2017

This version of the Mapbox macOS SDK corresponds to version 3.6.0 of the Mapbox iOS SDK.

### Packaging

* Xcode 8.0 or higher is now recommended for using this SDK. ([#8775](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8775))
* Updated MGLMapView’s logo view to display [the new Mapbox logo](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/new-mapbox-logo/). ([#8771](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8771), [#8773](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8773))

### Styles

* Added support for 3D extrusion of buildings and other polygonal features via the `MGLFillExtrusionStyleLayer` class and the `fill-extrusion` layer type in style JSON. ([#8431](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8431))
* MGLMapView and MGLTilePyramidOfflineRegion now default to version 10 of the Mapbox Streets style. Similarly, several style URL class methods of MGLStyle return URLs to version 10 styles. Unversioned variations of these methods are no longer deprecated. `MGLStyleDefaultVersion` should no longer be used with any style other than Streets. ([#6301](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6301))
* Added class methods to MGLStyle that correspond to the new [Traffic Day and Traffic Night](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/live-traffic-maps/) styles. ([#6301](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6301))
* MGLSymbolStyleLayer’s `iconImageName`, `iconScale`, `textFontSize`, `textOffset`, and `textRotation` properties can now be set to a source or composite function. ([#8544](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8544), [#8590](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8590), [#8592](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8592), [#8593](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8593))
* Fixed an issue where setting the `MGLVectorStyleLayer.predicate` property failed to take effect if the relevant source was not in use by a visible layer at the time. ([#8653](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8653))
* Fixed an issue preventing programmatically added style layers from appearing in already cached tiles. ([#8954](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8954))
* Fixed an issue causing a composite function’s highest zoom level stop to be misinterpreted. ([#8613](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8613), [#8790](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8790))
* Fixed an issue where re-adding a layer that had been previously removed from a style would reset its paint properties. Moved initializers for `MGLTileSource`, `MGLStyleLayer`, and `MGLForegroundStyleLayer` to their concrete subclasses; because these classes were already intended for initialization only via concrete subclasses, this should have no developer impact. ([#8626](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8626))
* Fixed a crash that occurred when removing a source that was still being used by one or more style layers. Since this is a programming error, a warning is logged to the console instead. ([#9129](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9129))
* Feature querying results now account for any changes to a feature’s size caused by a source or composite style function. ([#8665](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8665))
* Fixed the behavior of composite functions that specify fractional zoom level stops. ([#9289](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9289))
* Letter spacing is now disabled in Arabic text so that ligatures are drawn correctly. ([#9062](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9062))
* Improved the performance of styles using source and composite style functions. ([#9185](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9185), [#9257](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9257))

### Annotations

* The default marker image has been made slightly larger and now matches the version in the Mapbox iOS SDK. ([#9370](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9370))
* The `MGLPolyline.coordinate` and `MGLPolygon.coordinate` properties now return the midpoint and centroid, respectively, instead of the first coordinate. ([#8713](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8713))

### User interaction

* Fixed an issue causing the map to go blank during a flight animation that travels a very short distance. ([#9199](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9199))
* Fixed an issue causing the mouse cursor to jump after Shift- or Option-dragging the map. ([#9390](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9390))
* The Improve This Map button in the attribution action sheet now leads to a feedback tool that matches MGLMapView’s rotation and pitch. `-[MGLAttributionInfo feedbackURLAtCenterCoordinate:zoomLevel:]` no longer respects the feedback URL specified in TileJSON. ([#9078](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9078))

### Other changes

* Fixed a crash when calling `MGLMultiPolygon.coordinate` [#8713](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8713)
* Fixed an issue causing attribution button text to appear blue instead of black. ([#8701](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8701))
* Fixed a crash or console spew when MGLMapView is initialized with a frame smaller than 64 points wide by 64 points tall. ([#8562](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8562))
* The error passed into `-[MGLMapViewDelegate mapViewDidFailLoadingMap:withError:]` now includes a more specific description and failure reason. ([#8418](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8418))
* Improved CPU and battery performance while animating a tilted map’s camera in an area with many labels. ([#9031](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9031))
* Fixed an issue rendering polylines that contain duplicate vertices. ([#8808](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8808))
* Added struct boxing to `MGLCoordinateSpan`, `MGLCoordinateBounds`, `MGLOfflinePackProgress`, and `MGLTransition`. ([#9343](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9343))

## 0.4.1 - April 8, 2017

This version of the Mapbox macOS SDK corresponds to version 3.5.2 of the Mapbox iOS SDK.

* Fixed an issue causing code signing failures and bloating the framework. ([#8640](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8640))
* Fixed an issue that could cause a crash if annotations unknown to the map view were interacted with. ([#8686](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8686))
* Renamed the “Data-Driven Styling” guide to “Using Style Functions at Runtime” and clarified the meaning of data-driven styling in the guide’s discussion of runtime style functions. ([#8627](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8627))

## 0.4.0 - April 2, 2017

This version of the Mapbox macOS SDK corresponds to version 3.5.1 of the Mapbox iOS SDK.

### Internationalization

* Added support for right-to-left text and Arabic ligatures in labels. ([#6984](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6984), [#7123](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7123))
* Improved the line wrapping behavior of point-placed labels, especially labels written in Chinese and Japanese. ([#6828](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6828), [#7446](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7446))
* CJK characters now remain upright in vertically oriented labels that have line placement, such as road labels. ([#7114](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/issues/7114))
* Added Catalan, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Japanese, Lithuanian, Polish, Portuguese (Brazilian), Spanish, Swedish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese localizations. ([#7316](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7316), [#7503](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7503), [#7899](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7899), [#7999](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7999), [#8113](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8113), [#8256](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8256))

### Styles

* Added support for data-driven styling in the form of source and composite style functions. `MGLStyleFunction` is now an abstract class, with `MGLCameraStyleFunction` providing the behavior of `MGLStyleFunction` in previous releases. New `MGLStyleFunction` subclasses allow you to vary a style attribute by the values of attributes of features in the source. ([#7596](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7596))
* Added methods to MGLShapeSource and MGLVectorSource for querying features loaded by the source, whether or not they’re visible on the map. ([#8263](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8263))
* Added `circleStrokeColor`, `circleStrokeWidth`, and `circleStrokeOpacity` properties to MGLCircleStyleLayer and support for corresponding properties in style JSON files. ([#7356](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7356))
* Point-placed labels in symbol style layers are now placed at more optimal locations within polygons. ([#7465](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7465))
* Fixed flickering that occurred when manipulating a style layer. ([#7616](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7616))
* Symbol style layers can now render point collections (known as multipoints in GeoJSON). ([#7445](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7445))

* Fixed artifacts when drawing particularly acute line joins. ([#7786](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7786))
* Fixed an issue in which a vector style layer predicate involving the `$id` key path would exclude all features from the layer. ([#7989](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7989), [#7971](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7971))
* Fixed an issue causing vector style layer predicates to be evaluated as if each feature had a `$type` attribute of 1, 2, or 3. The `$type` key path can now be compared to `Point`, `LineString`, or `Polygon`, as described in the documentation. ([#7971](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7971))
* When setting an `MGLShapeSource`’s shape to an `MGLFeature` instance, any `NSColor` attribute value is now converted to the equivalent CSS string representation for use with `MGLInterpolationModeIdentity` in style functions. ([#8025](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8025))

This version of the Mapbox macOS SDK corresponds to version 3.4.2 of the Mapbox iOS SDK.

* Fixed an issue causing MGLMapView’s `camera`’s `heading` to be set to a negative value, indicating an undefined heading, when the map view faces northwest. The heading is now wrapped to between zero and 360 degrees, for consistency with MGLMapView’s `direction` property. ([#7724](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7724))
* Fixed a crash that occurred when moving a window containing an MGLMapView from one screen to another. ([#8004](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/8004))
* Fixed an issue preventing the use of the integrated GPU on machines that have more than one GPU. Follow the instructions in [Technical Q&A 1734](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/qa/qa1734/_index.html) to enable integrated GPU usage in your application. ([#7834](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7834))
* Fixed an issue causing the mouse cursor to jump after shift- or option-dragging a map view if the window opened on a screen with a different size than the screen with keyboard focus. ([#7846](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7846))
* Deprecated the style class methods in MGLStyle. ([#7785](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7785))
* Improved the performance of trivial camera animations. ([#7125](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7125))

## 0.3.0 - January 21, 2016

This version of the Mapbox macOS SDK corresponds to version 3.4.0 of the Mapbox iOS SDK. The two SDKs have very similar feature sets. The main differences are the lack of user location tracking and annotation views. Some APIs have been adapted to macOS conventions, particularly the use of NSPopover for callout views.

### Packaging

* Fixed an issue causing code signing failures and bloating the framework. ([#5850](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5850))

Similarly, GeoJSON sources specified by the stylesheet at design time can specify the `cluster`, `clusterMaxZoom`, and `clusterRadius` attributes. ([#5724](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5724))
* When creating an MGLTileSource, you can now specify that the tile URLs use [TMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tile_Map_Service) coordinates by setting `MGLTileSourceOptionTileCoordinateSystem` to `MGLTileCoordinateSystemTMS`. TileJSON files can specify `"scheme": "tms"`. ([#2270](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/2270))
* Fixed an issue causing abstract `MGLMultiPointFeature` objects to be returned in feature query results. Now concrete `MGLPointCollectionFeature` objects are returned. MGLMultiPointFeature is now an alias of MGLPointCollectionFeature. ([#6742](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6742))

* MGLFeature’s `attributes` and `identifier` properties are now writable. ([#6728](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6728))
* Attribution views now display the correct attribution for the current style. ([#5999](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5999))
* If MGLMapView is unable to obtain or parse a style, it now calls its delegate’s `-mapViewDidFailLoadingMap:withError:` method. ([#6145](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6145))
* Added the `-[MGLMapViewDelegate mapView:didFinishLoadingStyle:]` delegate method, which offers the earliest opportunity to modify the layout or appearance of the current style before the map view is displayed to the user. ([#6636](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6636))
* Fixed an issue causing stepwise zoom functions to be misinterpreted. ([#6328](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6328))

* Fixed an exception raised when adding a custom annotation model object to MGLMapView. ([#7746](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7746))
* Added new APIs to MGLMapView to query for visible annotations. ([#6061](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6061))
* Shape, feature, and annotation classes now conform to NSSecureCoding. ([#6559](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6559))
* Various method arguments that are represented as C arrays of `CLLocationCoordinate2D` instances have been marked `const` to streamline bridging to Swift. ([#7215](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7215))
* To make an MGLPolyline or MGLPolygon span the antimeridian, specify coordinates with longitudes greater than 180° or less than −180°. ([#6088](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6088))
* Fixed an issue where placing a point annotation on Null Island also placed a duplicate annotation on its antipode. ([#3563](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/3563))
* Fixed an issue that caused an assertion failure if a `MGLShapeCollection` (a GeoJSON GeometryCollection) was created with an empty array of shapes. ([#7632](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7632))
* Improved the precision of annotations at zoom levels greater than 18. ([#5517](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5517))

* Fixed an issue where the map view’s center would always be calculated as if the view occupied the entire window. ([#6102](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6102))
* Notification names and user info keys are now string enumeration values for ease of use in Swift. ([#6794](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/6794))
* Fixed a typo in the documentation for the MGLCompassDirectionFormatter class. ([#5879](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5879))
* The NSClickGestureRecognizer on MGLMapView that is used for selecting annotations now fails if a click does not select an annotation. ([#7246](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/7246))

## 0.2.1 - July 19, 2016

* Fixed a crash that occurred when a sprite URL lacks a file extension. See [this comment](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/issues/5722#issuecomment-233701251) to determine who may be affected by this bug. ([#5723](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5723))
* Right-clicking to open MGLMapView’s context menu no longer prevents the user from subsequently panning the map by clicking and dragging. ([#5593](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5593))
* Fixed an issue causing overlapping polylines and polygons to be drawn in undefined z-order. Shapes are always drawn in the order they are added to the map, from the oldest on the bottom to the newest on the top. ([#5710](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5710))
* Improved the design of the generated API documentation. ([#5306](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5306))
* As the user zooms in, tiles from lower zoom levels are scaled up until tiles for higher zoom levels are loaded. ([#5143](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5143))
* Per documentation, the first and last coordinates in an MGLPolygon must be identical in order for the polygon to draw correctly. The same is true for an MGLPolygon’s interior polygon. ([#5514](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5514))
* Added [quadkey](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb259689.aspx) support and limited WMS support in raster tile URL templates. ([#5628](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5628))

* Fixed an issue causing polyline and polygon annotations to disappear when the zoom level is one less than the maximum zoom level. ([#5418](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5418))
* Added a property to MGLOfflineStorage, `countOfBytesCompleted`, that indicates the disk space occupied by all cached and offline resources. ([#5585](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5585))
* The `text-pitch-alignment` property is now supported in stylesheets for improved street label legibility on a tilted map. ([#5288](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5288))
* The `icon-text-fit` and `icon-text-fit-padding` properties are now supported in stylesheets, allowing the background of a shield to automatically resize to fit the shield’s text. ([#5334](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5334))
* The `circle-pitch-scale` property is now supported in stylesheets, allowing circle features in a tilted base map to scale or remain the same size as the viewing distance changes. ([#5576](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5576))

* Replaced the wireframe debug mask with an overdraw visualization debug mask to match Mapbox GL JS’s overdraw inspector. ([#5403](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5403))
* MGLMapDebugOverdrawVisualizationMask and MGLMapDebugStencilBufferMask no longer have any effect in Release builds of the SDK. These debug masks have been disabled for performance reasons. ([#5555](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5555))

## 0.2.0 - June 14, 2016

* This version of the Mapbox macOS SDK roughly corresponds to version 3.3.0-beta.1 of the Mapbox iOS SDK. The two SDKs have very similar feature sets. The main differences are the lack of user location tracking and annotation views. Some APIs have been adapted to macOS conventions, particularly the use of NSPopover for callout views.

* Fixed a memory leak when using raster resources. ([#5141](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5141))
* Added `MGLCoordinateInCoordinateBounds()`, a function that tests whether or not a coordinate is in a given bounds. ([#5053](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/5053))
* Fixed an issue in which fade transitions (such as on street labels in some styles) lagged behind the map when quickly zooming in and out. ([#4579](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/4579))
* Added new options to `MGLMapDebugMaskOptions` that show wireframes and the stencil buffer instead of the color buffer. ([#4359](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/4359))
* Declarations in the API documentation are shown in both Objective-C and Swift. ([realm/jazzy#530](https://github.com/realm/jazzy/pull/530))

## 0.1.0 - May 10, 2016

* This version of the Mapbox OS X SDK roughly corresponds to version 3.3.0-alpha.2 of the Mapbox iOS SDK. The two SDKs have very similar feature sets.
