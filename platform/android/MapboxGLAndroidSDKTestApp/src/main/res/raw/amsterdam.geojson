After the second World war the desolated area was discovered by many artists, who established their homes and studios in the vacant buildings. During the second half of the 20th century the old warehouses were transformed into apartments one after another, and new apartments were built. Nevertheless a lot of the atmosphere of the glorious past is still present in the old buildings and wooden drawbridges."

The Amstelpark was built and opened for the 1972 Floriade gardening exhibition. The park offers the Amstel train which runs through the Rosarium, the rhododendron valley and the Riekermolen.  The park lost about 30 percent of its larger trees due to disease. The rhododendron valley contains about 139 species of rhododendrons, blooming between April and May.  At the Great Pond in the park is the Japanese Garden. At the time of the celebration of the 400-year relationship between the Netherlands and Japan in 2001, the gardens were renovated."
