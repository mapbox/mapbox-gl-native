# Mapbox Qt SDK

[![Circle CI build status](https://circleci.com/gh/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/mapbox/workflows/mapbox-gl-native/tree/master) [![AppVeyor CI build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/3q12kbcooc6df8uc?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Mapbox/mapbox-gl-native)

## Developing

This is the foundation for the [Mapbox GL plugin](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/location-plugin-mapboxgl.html)
available in the Qt SDK since Qt 5.9. Use the [Qt bugtracker](https://bugreports.qt.io) for bugs related
to the plugin and this GitHub repository for bugs related to Mapbox GL Native and the Qt bindings.

You should build this repository if you want to develop/contribute using the low level Qt C++ bindings or
want to contribute to the Mapbox GL Native projectusing the Qt port for debugging.

See the Mapbox Qt landing page for more details: https://www.mapbox.com/qt/

### Build dependencies

#### Linux

For Linux (tested on Ubuntu) desktop, together with these [build
instructions](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/tree/master/platform/linux#build),
you also need:

```
$ sudo apt-get install qt5-default
```

#### macOS

For macOS desktop, you can install Qt 5 via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```
$ brew install qt5
```

Since Homebrew doesn't add Qt to the path, you'll have to do that manually before running any Make target:

```
export PATH=/usr/local/opt/qt5/bin:$PATH
```

### Windows

The Windows build will assume you have installed and on the default path:

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2015
- [CMake 3.10.1+](https://cmake.org/download/)
- [LLVM 5.0.0+](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html)
- [Qt 5+](https://www.qt.io/download) with "msvc2015" support.

At runtime, you will also need installed:

- [OpenSSL 1.0.2+](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html)
- DirectX

### Build instructions

Public API headers
can be found in the [platform/qt/include](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/tree/master/platform/qt/include) directory.

#### Linux and macOS

#### QMapboxGL example application

```
$ make qt-lib      # Will build libqmapboxgl.so
$ make qt-app      # Will build the test app and libqmapboxgl.so if not built yet
$ make run-qt-app  # Will build and run the test app
```

#### Windows

The Windows build bot will publish MSVC 2015 compatible binaries and headers on every build
at the [artifacts](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/build/artifacts) tab.
These binaries can be downloaded and used right away.

In case of building from the sources:

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" -T LLVM-vs2014 -DMBGL_PLATFORM=qt -DWITH_QT_DECODERS=ON -DWITH_QT_I18N=ON -DWITH_NODEJS=OFF ..
$ cmake --build . --config Release --target qmapboxgl -- /m
```
