# Integrating custom builds of the Mapbox Maps SDK for iOS into your application

The [Mapbox Maps SDK for iOS](https://docs.mapbox.com/ios/maps/) moved out of this repository [in late 2019](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/issues/15971). To build a development version of the SDK for use in your own Cocoa Touch application, see the instructions now located [in the mapbox-gl-native-ios repository](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native-ios/tree/master/platform/ios/INSTALL.md). To use a production-ready version of the SDK, see the [Mapbox Maps SDK for iOS installation page](https://www.mapbox.com/install/ios/).
