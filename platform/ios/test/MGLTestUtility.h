/**
 MGL_CHECK_IF_PENDING_TEST_SHOULD_RUN()

 Include this macro at the top of a "pending" test - one that would normally fail,
 but you want to include is as a compile-time test or as a reminder.

 This will output the included warning in the test log, which `xcpretty` will detect.
 This allows such pending tests to be identified in CI logs.

 If you provide `MAPBOX_RUN_PENDING_TESTS` as an environment variable ALL pending
 tests will run.

 In addition, it's a good idea to append `PENDING` to the test method name, as this
 will also be picked up by xcpretty. PENDING tests will be distinguished by a `â§–`
 and `[PENDING]`
