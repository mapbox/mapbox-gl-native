[![Circle CI build status](https://circleci.com/gh/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/mapbox/workflows/mapbox-gl-native/tree/master)

A library based on [Mapbox GL Native](../../README.md) for embedding interactive map views with scalable, customizable vector maps into Cocoa Touch applications on iOS using Objective-C, Swift, or Interface Builder.

This repository is for day-to-day development of the SDK. Building the SDK yourself requires [a number of dependencies and steps](../../INSTALL.md) that are unnecessary for developing production applications. For production applications, please consider installing an official, prebuilt release instead; see the [Mapbox Maps SDK for iOS website](https://docs.mapbox.com/ios/maps/) for installation instructions.
