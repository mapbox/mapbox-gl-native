# [Mapbox iOS SDK](https://www.mapbox.com/ios-sdk/)

[![Bitrise](https://www.bitrise.io/app/7514e4cf3da2cc57.svg?token=OwqZE5rSBR9MVWNr_lf4sA&branch=master)](https://www.bitrise.io/app/7514e4cf3da2cc57)

A library based on [Mapbox GL Native](../../README.md) for embedding interactive map views with scalable, customizable vector maps into Cocoa Touch applications on iOS 7.0 and above using Objective-C, Swift, or Interface Builder.

This repository is for day-to-day development of the SDK. Building the SDK yourself requires [a number of dependencies and steps](../../INSTALL.md) that are unnecessary for developing production applications. For production applications, please consider installing an official, prebuilt release instead; see the [Mapbox iOS SDK website](https://www.mapbox.com/ios-sdk/) for installation instructions.
