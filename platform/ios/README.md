## iOS

This folder contains build configuration files for the iOS distribution of Mapbox GL Native, which ultimately targets Cocoa Touch applications written in Objective-C, Swift, or Interface Builder via the [Mapbox Maps SDK for iOS](https://docs.mapbox.com/ios/maps/). The SDK was previously developed here in this repository but is now developed [in the separate mapbox-gl-native-ios repository](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native-ios/tree/master/platform/ios/) ([details](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/issues/15971)).
