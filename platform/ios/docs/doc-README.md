# [Mapbox iOS SDK](https://www.mapbox.com/ios-sdk/)

The Mapbox iOS SDK is an open-source framework for embedding interactive map views with scalable, customizable vector maps into Cocoa Touch applications on iOS 7.0 and above using Objective-C, Swift, or Interface Builder. It takes stylesheets that conform to the [Mapbox Style Specification](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-style-spec/), applies them to vector tiles that conform to the [Mapbox Vector Tile Specification](https://www.mapbox.com/developers/vector-tiles/), and renders them using OpenGL.
