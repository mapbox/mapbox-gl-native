# Changelog for Mapbox Maps SDK for iOS

The [Mapbox Maps SDK for iOS](https://docs.mapbox.com/ios/maps/) moved out of this repository [in late 2019](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/issues/15971). The changelog is now located [in the mapbox-gl-native-ios repository](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native-ios/tree/master/platform/ios/CHANGELOG.md).
