/**
 An interactive, customizable map view with an interface similar to the one
 provided by Apple’s MapKit.

 Using `MGLMapView`, you can embed the map inside a view, allow users to
 manipulate it with standard gestures, animate the map between different
 viewpoints, and present information in the form of annotations and overlays.

 The map view loads scalable vector tiles that conform to the
 <a href="https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec">Mapbox Vector Tile Specification</a>.
 It styles them with a style that conforms to the
 <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-style-spec/">Mapbox Style Specification</a>.
 Such styles can be designed in
 <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/studio/">Mapbox Studio</a> and hosted on
 mapbox.com.

 A collection of Mapbox-hosted styles is available through the `MGLStyle`
 class. These basic styles use
 <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/developers/vector-tiles/mapbox-streets">Mapbox Streets</a>
 or <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/satellite/">Mapbox Satellite</a> data
 sources, but you can specify a custom style that makes use of your own data.

 Mapbox-hosted vector tiles and styles require an API access token, which you
 can obtain from the
 <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/studio/account/tokens/">Mapbox account page</a>.
 Access tokens associate requests to Mapbox’s vector tile and style APIs with
 your Mapbox account. They also deter other developers from using your styles
 without your permission.

 Adding your own gesture recognizer to `MGLMapView` will block the corresponding
 gesture recognizer built into `MGLMapView`. To avoid conflicts, define which
 gesture takes precedence. For example, you can create your own
 `UITapGestureRecognizer` that will be invoked only if the default `MGLMapView`
 tap gesture fails:

 ```swift
 let mapTapGestureRecognizer = UITapGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(myCustomFunction))
 for recognizer in mapView.gestureRecognizers! where recognizer is UITapGestureRecognizer {
     mapTapGestureRecognizer.require(toFail: recognizer)
 }
 mapView.addGestureRecognizer(mapTapGestureRecognizer)
 ```

 @note You are responsible for getting permission to use the map data and for
 ensuring that your use adheres to the relevant terms of use.

 Returns an array of rendered map features that intersect with a given point,

 Each object in the returned array represents a feature rendered by the

 content sources. The returned array includes features loaded by
 `MGLShapeSource` and `MGLVectorSource` objects but does not include anything
 from `MGLRasterSource` objects, or from image, video, or canvas sources, which
 are unsupported by this SDK.

 The returned features are drawn by a style layer in the current style. For
 example, suppose the current style uses the
 <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/vector-tiles/mapbox-streets/">Mapbox Streets source</a>,
 but none of the specified style layers includes features that have the `maki`
 property set to `bus`. If you pass a point corresponding to the location of a
 bus stop into this method, the bus stop feature does not appear in the
 resulting array. On the other hand, if the style does include bus stops, an
 `MGLFeature` object representing that bus stop is returned and its
 `featureAttributes` dictionary has the `maki` key set to `bus` (along with
 other attributes). The dictionary contains only the attributes provided by the
 tile source; it does not include computed attribute values or rules about how
 the feature is rendered by the current style.

 The returned array is sorted by z-order, starting with the topmost rendered
 feature and ending with the bottommost rendered feature. A feature that is
 rendered multiple times due to wrapping across the antimeridian at low zoom
 levels is included only once, subject to the caveat that follows.

 Features come from tiled vector data or GeoJSON data that is converted to tiles
 internally, so feature geometries are clipped at tile boundaries and features
 may appear duplicated across tiles. For example, suppose the specified point
 lies along a road that spans the screen. The resulting array includes those
 parts of the road that lie within the map tile that contain the specified
 point, even if the road extends into other tiles.

 To find out the layer names in a particular style, view the style in
 <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/studio/">Mapbox Studio</a>.

 Only visible features are returned. To obtain features regardless of
 visibility, use the
 `-[MGLVectorSource featuresInSourceLayersWithIdentifiers:predicate:]` and
 `-[MGLShapeSource featuresMatchingPredicate:]` methods on the relevant sources.

 The returned features may also include features corresponding to annotations.
 These features are not object-equal to the `MGLAnnotation` objects that were

 `visibleAnnotations` or `-[MGLMapView visibleAnnotationsInRect:]`.
