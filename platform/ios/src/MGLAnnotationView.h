/**
 The `MGLAnnotationView` class is responsible for marking a point annotation
 with a view. Annotation views represent an annotation object, which is an
 object that corresponds to the `MGLAnnotation` protocol. When an annotation’s
 geographic coordinate is visible in the map view, the map view asks its
 delegate to a corresponding annotation view. If an annotation view is created
 with a reuse identifier, the map view may recycle the view when it goes
 offscreen.

 Annotation views are compatible with UIKit, Core Animation, and other Cocoa
 Touch frameworks. On the other hand, if you do not need animation or
 interactivity such as dragging, you can use an `MGLAnnotationImage` instead to
 conserve memory and optimize drawing performance.

 Initializes and returns a new annotation view object.

 The reuse identifier provides a way for you to improve performance by recycling

 Initializes and returns a new annotation view object.
 
 Providing an annotation allows you to explicitly associate the annotation instance
 with the new view and, in custom subclasses of `MGLAnnotationView`, customize the view
 based on properties of the annotation instance in an overridden initializer. However,
 annotation views that are reused will not necessarily be associated with the
 same annotation they were initialized with. Also, annotation views that are in
 the reuse queue will have a nil value for the annotation property. Passing an annotation
 instance to the view is optional and the map view will automatically associate annotations
 with views when views are provided to the map via the `-[MGLMapViewDelegate mapView:viewForAnnotation:]`
 method.

/**
 The offset, measured in points, at which to place the center of the view.

 By default, the center point of an annotation view is placed at the geographic
 coordinate point of the associated annotation. If you do not want the view to
 be centered, you can use this property to reposition the view. The offset’s
 `dx` and `dy` values are measured in points. Positive offset values move the
 annotation view down and to the right, while negative values move it up and to
 the left.

 Set the offset if the annotation view’s visual center point is somewhere other
 than the logical center of the view. For example, the view may contain an image
 that depicts a downward-pointing pushpin or thumbtack, with the tip positioned
 at the center-bottom of the view. In that case, you would set the offset’s `dx`
 to zero and its `dy` to half the height of the view.

/**
 A Boolean value that determines whether the annotation view grows and shrinks
 as the distance between the viewpoint and the annotation view changes on a

 When the value of this property is `YES` and the map is tilted, the annotation
 view appears smaller if it is towards the top of the view (closer to the
 horizon) and larger if it is towards the bottom of the view (closer to the
 viewpoint). This is also the behavior of `MGLAnnotationImage` objects. When the
 value of this property is `NO` or the map’s pitch is zero, the annotation view
 remains the same size regardless of its position on-screen.

 The default value of this property is `NO`. Keep this property set to `NO` if
 the view’s legibility is important.

    performance. Consider keeping this property disabled if your use case
    involves hundreds or thousands of annotation views.

 By default, this property is set to `NO` and becomes `YES` when the user taps
 the view. Selecting another annotation, whether it is associated with an
 `MGLAnnotationView` or `MGLAnnotationImage` object, deselects any currently
 selected view.

 immediately. If you want the change to be animated, use the
 `-setSelected:animated:` method instead.

#pragma mark Supporting Drag Operations

 A Boolean value indicating whether the annotation view is draggable.

 If this property is set to `YES`, the user can drag the annotation after
 pressing and holding the view, and the associated annotation object must also
 implement the `-setCoordinate:` method. The default value of this property is
 `NO`.

 Setting this property to `YES` lets the map view know that the annotation is
 always draggable. In other words, you cannot conditionalize drag operations by
 attempting to stop an operation that has already been initiated; doing so can
 lead to undefined behavior. Once begun, the drag operation should always
 continue to completion.
