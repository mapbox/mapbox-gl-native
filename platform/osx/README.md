# Mapbox OS X SDK

[![Bitrise](https://www.bitrise.io/app/155ef7da24b38dcd.svg?token=4KSOw_gd6WxTnvGE2rMttg&branch=master)](https://www.bitrise.io/app/155ef7da24b38dcd)

A library based on [Mapbox GL Native](../../README.md) for embedding interactive map views with scalable, customizable vector maps into Cocoa applications on OS X 10.10.0 and above using Objective-C, Swift, or Interface Builder.

This SDK is analogous to the Mapbox iOS SDK, and much of the iOS SDK documentation applies here. Mapbox does not officially support the OS X SDK to the same extent as the iOS SDK; however, bug reports and pull requests are certainly welcome.
