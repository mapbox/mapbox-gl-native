 An `MGLSymbolStyleLayer` is a style layer that renders icon and text labels at
 points or along lines on the map.
 
 Use a symbol style layer to configure the visual appearance of feature labels.
 These features can come from vector tiles loaded by an `MGLVectorTileSource`
 object, or they can be `MGLShape` or `MGLFeature` instances in an
 `MGLShapeSource` or `MGLComputedShapeSource` object.

 You can access an existing symbol style layer using the
 `-[MGLStyle layerWithIdentifier:]` method if you know its identifier;
 otherwise, find it using the `MGLStyle.layers` property. You can also create a
 new symbol style layer and add it to the style using a method such as
 `-[MGLStyle addLayer:]`.

 ### Example

 ```swift
 let layer = MGLSymbolStyleLayer(identifier: "coffeeshops", source: pois)
 layer.sourceLayerIdentifier = "pois"
 layer.iconImageName = NSExpression(forConstantValue: "coffee")
 layer.iconScale = NSExpression(forConstantValue: 0.5)
 layer.text = NSExpression(forKeyPath: "name")
 layer.textTranslation = NSExpression(forConstantValue: NSValue(cgVector: CGVector(dx: 10, dy: 0)))
 layer.textJustification = NSExpression(forConstantValue: "left")
 layer.textAnchor = NSExpression(forConstantValue: "left")
 layer.predicate = NSPredicate(format: "%K == %@", "venue-type", "coffee")
 mapView.style?.addLayer(layer)
