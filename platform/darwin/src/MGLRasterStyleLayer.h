/**
 An `MGLRasterStyleLayer` is a style layer that renders georeferenced raster
 imagery on the map, especially raster tiles.
 
 Use a raster style layer to configure the color parameters of raster tiles
 loaded by an `MGLRasterSource` object or raster images loaded by an
 `MGLImageSource` object. For example, you could use a raster style layer to
 render <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/satellite/">Mapbox Satellite</a>
 imagery, a <a
 href="https://www.mapbox.com/help/define-tileset/#raster-tilesets">raster tile
 set</a> uploaded to Mapbox Studio, or a raster map authored in <a
 href="https://tilemill-project.github.io/tilemill/">TileMill</a>, the classic
 Mapbox Editor, or Mapbox Studio Classic.
 
 Raster images may also be used as icons or patterns in a style layer. To
 register an image for use as an icon or pattern, use the `-[MGLStyle
 setImage:forName:]` method. To configure a point annotation’s image, use the
 `MGLAnnotationImage` class.

 You can access an existing raster style layer using the
 `-[MGLStyle layerWithIdentifier:]` method if you know its identifier;
 otherwise, find it using the `MGLStyle.layers` property. You can also create a
 new raster style layer and add it to the style using a method such as
 `-[MGLStyle addLayer:]`.

 ### Example

 ```swift
 let layer = MGLRasterStyleLayer(identifier: "clouds", source: source)
 layer.rasterOpacity = NSExpression(forConstantValue: 0.5)
 mapView.style?.addLayer(layer)
 ```
