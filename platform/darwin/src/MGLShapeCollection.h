/**
 An `MGLShapeCollection` object represents a shape consisting of zero or more
 distinct but related shapes that are instances of `MGLShape`. The constituent
 shapes can be a mixture of different kinds of shapes.
 
 `MGLShapeCollection` is most commonly used to add multiple shapes to a single
 `MGLShapeSource`. Configure the appearance of an `MGLShapeSource`’s or
 `MGLVectorSource`’s shape collection collectively using an
 `MGLSymbolStyleLayer` object, or use multiple instances of
 `MGLCircleStyleLayer`, `MGLFillStyleLayer`, and `MGLLineStyleLayer` to
 configure the appearance of each kind of shape inside the collection.
 
 You cannot add an `MGLShapeCollection` object directly to a map view as an
 annotation. However, you can create individual `MGLPointAnnotation`,
 `MGLPolyline`, and `MGLPolygon` objects from the `shapes` array and add those
 annotation objects to the map view using the `-[MGLMapView addAnnotations:]`
 method.
 
 To represent a collection of point, polyline, or polygon shapes, it may be more
 convenient to use an `MGLPointCollection`, `MGLMultiPolyline`, or
 `MGLMultiPolygon` object, respectively.
 
 A shape collection is known as a 
 <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.1.8">GeometryCollection</a> 
 geometry in GeoJSON.
