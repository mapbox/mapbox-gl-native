/**
 An `MGLPointAnnotation` object represents a one-dimensional shape located at a
 single geographical coordinate. Depending on how it is used, an
 `MGLPointAnnotation` object is known as a point annotation or point shape. For
 example, you could use a point shape to represent a city at low zoom levels, an
 address at high zoom levels, or the location of a long press gesture.

 You can add point shapes to the map by adding them to an `MGLShapeSource`
 object. Configure the appearance of an `MGLShapeSource`’s or
 `MGLVectorTileSource`’s point shapes collectively using an `MGLCircleStyleLayer` or
 `MGLSymbolStyleLayer` object.

 For more interactivity, add a selectable point annotation to a map view using
 the `-[MGLMapView addAnnotation:]` method. Alternatively, define your own model
 class that conforms to the `MGLAnnotation` protocol. Configure a point
 annotation’s appearance using
 `-[MGLMapViewDelegate mapView:imageForAnnotation:]` or
 `-[MGLMapViewDelegate mapView:viewForAnnotation:]` (iOS only). A point
 annotation’s `MGLShape.title` and `MGLShape.subtitle` properties define the
 default content of the annotation’s callout (on iOS) or popover (on macOS).

 To group multiple related points together in one shape, use an
 `MGLPointCollection` or `MGLShapeCollection` object. To access
 a point’s attributes, use an `MGLPointFeature` object.

 A point shape is known as a
 <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.1.2">Point</a> geometry
 in GeoJSON.
