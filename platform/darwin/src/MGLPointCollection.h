 The `MGLPointCollection` class is used to define an array of disconnected 
 coordinates. The points in the collection may be related but are not 
 connected visually in any way.
 
 @note `MGLPointCollection` objects cannot be added to a map view using
 `-[MGLMapView addAnnotations:]` and related methods. However, when used in a
 `MGLPointCollectionFeature` to initialize a `MGLShapeSource` that is added
 to the map view's style, the point collection represents as a group of distinct 
 annotations.
