 An `MGLOpenGLStyleLayer` is a style layer that is rendered by OpenGL code that
 you provide.

 By default, this class does nothing. You can subclass this class to provide
 custom OpenGL drawing code that is run on each frame of the map. Your subclass
 should override the `-didMoveToMapView:`, `-willMoveFromMapView:`, and
 `-drawInMapView:withContext:` methods.

 You can access an existing OpenGL style layer using the
 `-[MGLStyle layerWithIdentifier:]` method if you know its identifier;
 otherwise, find it using the `MGLStyle.layers` property. You can also create a
 new OpenGL style layer and add it to the style using a method such as
 `-[MGLStyle addLayer:]`.
