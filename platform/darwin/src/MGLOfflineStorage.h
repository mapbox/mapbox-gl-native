/**
 Posted by the shared `MGLOfflineStorage` object when an `MGLOfflinePack`
 object’s progress changes. The progress may change due to a resource being
 downloaded or because the pack discovers during the download that more
 resources are required for offline viewing. This notification is posted
 whenever any field in the `progress` property changes.

 The `object` is the `MGLOfflinePack` object whose progress changed. The
 `userInfo` dictionary contains the pack’s current state in the
 `MGLOfflinePackUserInfoKeyState` key and details about the pack’s current
 progress in the `MGLOfflinePackUserInfoKeyProgress` key. You may also consult
 the `MGLOfflinePack.state` and `MGLOfflinePack.progress` properties, which
 provide the same values.

 If you only need to observe changes in a particular pack’s progress, you can
 alternatively observe KVO change notifications to the pack’s `progress` key
 path.
