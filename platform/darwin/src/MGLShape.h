/**
 `MGLShape` is an abstract class that represents a shape or annotation. Shapes
 constitute the content of a map – not only the overlays atop the map, but also
 the content that forms the base map.

 Create instances of `MGLPointAnnotation`, `MGLPointCollection`, `MGLPolyline`,
 `MGLMultiPolyline`, `MGLPolygon`, `MGLMultiPolygon`, or `MGLShapeCollection` in
 order to use `MGLShape`'s methods. Do not create instances of `MGLShape` directly,
 and do not create your own subclasses of this class. The shape classes correspond
 to the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.1">Geometry</a> object
 types in the GeoJSON standard, but some have nonstandard names for backwards
 compatibility.

 Although you do not create instances of this class directly, you can use its
 `+[MGLShape shapeWithData:encoding:error:]` factory method to create one of the
 concrete subclasses of `MGLShape` noted above from GeoJSON data.

 You can add shapes to the map by adding them to an `MGLShapeSource` object.
 Configure the appearance of an `MGLShapeSource`’s or `MGLVectorSource`’s shapes
 collectively using a concrete instance of `MGLVectorStyleLayer`. Alternatively,
 you can add some kinds of shapes directly to a map view as annotations or
 overlays.

#pragma mark Creating a Shape

/**
 Returns an `MGLShape` object initialized with the given data interpreted as a
 string containing a GeoJSON object.

 If the GeoJSON object is a geometry, the returned value is a kind of
 `MGLShape`. If it is a feature object, the returned value is a kind of
 `MGLShape` that conforms to the `MGLFeature` protocol. If it is a feature
 collection object, the returned value is an instance of
 `MGLShapeCollectionFeature`.

 ### Example

 ```swift
 let url = mainBundle.url(forResource: "amsterdam", withExtension: "geojson")!
 let data = try! Data(contentsOf: url)
 let feature = try! MGLShape(data: data, encoding: String.Encoding.utf8.rawValue) as! MGLShapeCollectionFeature
 ```

 @param data String data containing GeoJSON source code.
 @param encoding The encoding used by `data`.
 @param outError Upon return, if an error has occurred, a pointer to an
    `NSError` object describing the error. Pass in `NULL` to ignore any error.
 @return An `MGLShape` object representation of `data`, or `nil` if `data` could
    not be parsed as valid GeoJSON source code. If `nil`, `outError` contains an
    `NSError` object describing the problem.
