# Running Mapbox GL Native on a hardware Android device

First read the [Google documentation](http://developer.android.com/tools/device.html) to set up your device and your OS to connect to the device.

When you plug your device in and then run or debug the Android project you will see a window "Choose Device". Choose your device from the "Choose a running device" list.

If your device does not show up, double check the [Google documentation](http://developer.android.com/tools/device.html).
